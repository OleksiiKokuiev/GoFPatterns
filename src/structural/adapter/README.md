Pattern: Adapter
======================
Objective:
Transformation of interface to interface which is needed for the client.

Purpose of usage:
Using for joint working of classes, which have incompatible interfaces.

Use cases:
- an interface we gonna use doesn't correspond our needs;
- the class is needed which should collaborate with other unknown or non-relational classes;
- we need use a few existing sub-classes, but it's impractical to use methods of these classes creating their new sub-classes
