Pattern: Prototype
===========================
Objective:
Define type of creating objects through instance-prototype and to create new objects, based on that prototype

Purpose of usage:
For creation copies given object

Use cases:
- instance of class which should be created are defining in runtime;
- to avoid a building hierarchy of classes, factories or parallel hierarchy of classes;
- instance of class could be in one from several states.
