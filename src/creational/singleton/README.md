Pattern: Singleton
===============================
Objective:
To ensure that class will have only one instance and only one point of aceess will be available

Purpose of usage:
For creating single instance of concrete class

Use cases:
- Only one instance of concrete class is needed. That instance is available for all clients;
- The only instance must be inherited by subclassing, while clients can work with the inheriting class without modifying their code.
