Pattern: Abstract Factory
==============================
Objective:
Creation of an interface for creating few interconnected or interdependent objects without rigidly bound to specific classes

Purpose of usage:
For creating multiplicity of interconnected objects

Use cases:
- System shouldn't depend on method of creation, layout and view of inside objects;
- Income interconnected objects should be used together;
- System should be configurable using one of objects multiplicity that system is based on;
- We need provide multiplicity of objects but using interfaces only to be implemented.
